# Scholar Publication Exporter

A very _easy_ and _vulnerable_ script to export publication list from Google Scholar profile.

### Disadvantages and Vulnerabilities

- Hardcoded URL and attributes to be extracted.
- Manual effort to firstly expand the publication list.
- No error handling and will be crashed if Google reCAPTCHA is triggered.
- Only text output on the console.

### Requirements

Python environment with selenium and webdriver-manager installed.

### Usage

Hardcode URL of Google Scholar profile in the script and run it.

### TODO

- [ ] Add support for different output formats.
- [ ] Add parameterized input.
- [ ] Add automatic expansion of publication list.
